## Description

Factory floor quality control/accountability manager software.

Client: Large scale mass production, modeled after a cup factory but adaptable to other settings.

This app is intended to streamline the production process and make it easier to 
maintain accountability across a chaotic production environment.

It accesses and changes an isolated database that is always available to users of the app.

There are three different kinds of users:

      Employee: who is in charge of inspecting product as it goes down the line and disposing of 
      defective products as well as alerting supervisors of repeated defects
      
      Supervisor: who is in charge of multiple assembly lines at once and recieves reports of
      defective products from employees, and has the authority to shut down a production line
      for maintenance as well as confronting employees that have a history of make mistakes
      
      Administrator: is in charge of the entire factory floor, recieves reports from supervisor
      about problem employees and is able to hire (add employees to database) and fire (remove 
      employees from database)
